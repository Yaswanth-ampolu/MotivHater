Ultimate Prompt for Advanced Web Designer & Developer (Ready to Deploy) üöÄ
This prompt will guide the advanced web designer and developer to create a fully responsive, interactive, and engaging landing page that integrates AI elements like personalized roasts and motivation while also delivering a memorable user experience.

Task Overview:
We are building a cutting-edge, highly interactive landing page for a productivity app that combines AI-powered motivation and gamification (like Duolingo) with a fun, engaging experience for users. The website should be fully responsive, visually stunning, and optimized for fast performance. It should be ready for deployment with SEO optimizations, mobile-first design, and smooth animations.

Tech Stack to Use:
Frontend:
Next.js or SvelteKit (for server-side rendering and fast loading)
Tailwind CSS (for flexible and modern styling)
GSAP or Framer Motion (for advanced animations and smooth scrolling effects)
Lottie (for interactive mascot animation)
Backend (Optional):
Vercel or Netlify (for deploying static assets with automatic optimizations)
AI Integration (Optional for Future):
OpenAI API or Ollama for local models (for generating AI responses such as roasts and motivation)
